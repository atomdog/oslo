The oslo (open source loop operator) project is an effort to produce an esoteric open source virtual assistant framework that is:

- meant to be hacked on
- diverse in functionality
- privacy concious
- a stepping stone for creating more sophisticated agents 

## why? 
- [why is it named a 'loop operator'?](https://github.com/atomdog/oslo/wiki/Some-Background)
- [why do this?](https://github.com/atomdog/oslo/wiki/Some-Background)
- [why not use siri or alexa or google home?](https://github.com/atomdog/oslo/wiki/Some-Background)

## Getting things running
- the required models can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/KegjSQAC#Xs4SzflsKlT5jeXkuvB06Q)
- the [wiki](https://github.com/atomdog/oslo/wiki/Spinning-things-up) guide on getting started
## Development
- [developer notes](devnotes.md) contains bi-weekly informal entries on progress
- the [jira](https://buspark.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/OSLO/boards/25/roadmap) has a more formal log
